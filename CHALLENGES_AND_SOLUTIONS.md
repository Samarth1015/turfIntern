# Challenges Faced & Solutions

## ðŸš§ Challenges Encountered

### 1. **Database Schema Design Complexity**
**Challenge**: Designing a flexible database schema that could handle different types of sports courts, varying time slots, and complex booking relationships while maintaining data integrity.

**Solution**: Used Prisma ORM with a well-thought-out relational design:
- **Court** model as the central entity
- **TimeSlot** model with unique constraints to prevent double bookings
- **Booking** model with proper foreign key relationships
- Implemented soft deletes for data preservation

### 2. **Time Slot Availability Logic**
**Challenge**: Implementing logic to check real-time availability of time slots considering day of week, existing bookings, and date constraints.

**Solution**: Created a dedicated `findAvailableSlots` method that:
- Filters slots by court and day of week
- Checks existing bookings for the selected date
- Returns only truly available slots
- Handles edge cases like past dates and invalid selections

### 3. **Frontend State Management**
**Challenge**: Managing complex state for court selection, date picking, time slot availability, and booking form data without over-engineering.

**Solution**: Used React hooks effectively:
- `useState` for local component state
- `useEffect` for side effects and API calls
- Proper state lifting for shared data
- Clean separation of concerns between components

### 4. **API Error Handling & Validation**
**Challenge**: Implementing comprehensive error handling and input validation across all API endpoints while maintaining consistent response formats.

**Solution**: Standardized error handling approach:
- Try-catch blocks in all async operations
- Consistent error response format with success flags
- Input validation for required fields
- Business logic validation (e.g., future dates only)
- Proper HTTP status codes

### 5. **CORS Configuration**
**Challenge**: Setting up proper CORS configuration to allow frontend-backend communication during development and production.

**Solution**: Implemented flexible CORS middleware:
- Environment-based CORS configuration
- Proper preflight request handling
- Support for multiple origins
- Security headers configuration

### 6. **Database Seeding & Migration**
**Challenge**: Creating realistic test data and ensuring database migrations work correctly across different environments.

**Solution**: Built comprehensive seeding system:
- Created seed script with realistic court and time slot data
- Used upsert operations to prevent duplicate data
- Generated time slots for all days of the week
- Added npm scripts for easy database setup
